    <h2> Early Life and Education </h2>

    <h4>
        Ivan Petrovich Pavlov was born on September 14, 1849, in Ryazan, Russia. The son of a priest, he attended a church school and theological seminary. However, he was inspired by the ideas of Charles Darwin and I.M. Sechenov, the father of Russian physiology,
        and gave up his theological studies in favor of scientific pursuit. Pavlov studied chemistry and physiology at the University of St. Petersburg and received the degree of Candidate of Natural Sciences in 1875. He then enrolled at the Imperial
        Medical Academy in St. Petersburg, completing his graduate dissertation on the centrifugal nerves of the heart in 1883. The following year, he travelled to Leipzig to study under supervision of German physician Carl Ludwig before returning in
        1886. In 1890, Pavlov accepted a role as professor of pharmacology at the Military Medical Academy, and in 1895 he was appointed chair of the Institute of Experimental Medicineâ€™s Department of Physiology. He retained his position at the institute
        until 1925.
